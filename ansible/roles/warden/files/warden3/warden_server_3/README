A. Introduction

   Warden is a system for efficient sharing information about detected events
(threats). Warden Server is server-side part of the software, the
communication hub, allowing to publish detected events and download yet
unprocessed ones.

   The events are exchanged in Idea, flexible and descriptive event JSON
serialized format. Warden 3 protocol is based on plain HTTPS queries with
help of JSON, so the clients can be thin and simple.

   For description of API see Warden Client, this document describes basics
of Warden Server administration.

   Warden Server is Python/WSGI based, written primarily with Apache mod_wsgi
in mind. Other WSGI servers/frameworks are not yet tested, so your mileage
may vary. Authentication is X509 certificate (for machine or client
identification) + shared secret (for client icentification, where
certificate does not suffice).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Dependencies

 1. Platform

    Python 2.7+
	Apache 2.2
	mod_wsgi 3.3+

 2. Python modules

    python-mysqldb 5.3.3+
    python-m2crypto 0.20+
    jsonschema 2.4+

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Installation

 * Untar distribution archive into required destination
   (We're using /opt as an example.)

   # cd /opt
   # tar xjf warden_server_3.0.tar.bz2
   # ls
   warden_server_3.0

 * Create database and desired database users
   (We're using db "warden3" and user "warden@localhost" as an example.)

   # mysql -p

   mysql> CREATE DATABASE warden3;
   mysql> GRANT ALL ON warden3.* TO `warden`@`localhost`;
   mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'warden'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('example');
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEDGES;

 * Create necessary table structure

   mysql -p -u warden warden3 < warden3.0.sql

 * Enable mod_wsgi, mod_ssl, include Warden configuration

   This depends heavily on your distribution and Apache configuration.
   Basically you need to create and include apache.conf:

      Include /opt/warden_server_3.0/apache.conf

   or paste the contents into whichever Directory, Location or VirtualHost
   you dedicate for Warden. You can use apache.conf.dist as an example.

   You may need to change paths to certificate/key/ca material, path to
   warden_server.wsgi and web path alias.

   Also note that warden_server itself is NOT thread safe, so included
   configuration expects Apache with mpm-prefork worker, or you will have
   to configure mod_wsgi as separate process with threads=1.

   Also, for warden_server.wsgi, you can use warden_server.wsgi.dist as
   a template. You will possibly need to change at least configuration
   file path.

 * Configure Warden server (see next chapter)

 * Reload Apache

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. Configuration

   Configuration is JSON object in file (warden_server.cfg by default),
however, lines starting with "#" or "//" are allowed and will be ignored as
comments. File must contain valid JSON object, containing configuration. See
also warden_server.cfg.dist as example.

   Top level JSON object contains subsections, which configure particular
aspect of the server. Each subsection can contain "type" key, which chooses
particular implementation object of the aspect, for example type of logger
(file, syslog), such as:

   {
      "Log": {
         "type": "SysLogger",
         ...
      },
      "DB": { ... }
   }

   Sections and their "type" objects can be:

		Log: FileLogger, SysLogger
		DB: MySQL
		Auth: X509Authenticator, NoAuthenticator
		Validator: JSONSchemaValidator, "NoValidator
		Handler: WardenHandler

	"type" keyword is not mandatory, if not specified, first implementation
object from particular section list is used ("FileLogger" for example).

   Object function and configuration keys are as follows:

   FileLogger: logging into file on the filesystem
      filename: name of the file, defaults to "warden_server.log" at
		        installation directory
      level: least log level (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)

   SysLogger: logging into unix syslog
      socket: path to syslog socket, defaults to "/dev/log"
      facility: syslog facility, defaults to "daemon"
      level: least log level (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)

   NoAuthenticator: forego authentication, for debug purposes

   X509Authenticator: authenticate based on certificate chain validation,
       hostname corresponding with certificate CN or SubjectAltName and
       optionally shared secret

   NoValidator: forego event JSON validation, for debug purposes

   JSONSchemaValidator: validate incoming events based on JSON schema file
      filename: path to schema file, defaults to "idea.schema" at
                installation directory

   MySQL: database storage backend
      host: database server host, default "localhost"
      user: database user, default "warden"
      password: database password
      dbname: database name, default "warden3"
      port: database server port, default 3306
      retry_pause: retry in case of database errors, in seconds, defaults to 5
      retry_count: number of retries, defaults to 3
      event_size_limit: max size of serialized event, defaults to 5 MB
      catmap_filename: IDEA category mapping to database ids, defaults to
                       "catmap_mysql.json" at installation directory
      tagmap_filename": IDEA node type mapping to database ids, defaults to
                        "tagmap_mysql.json" at installation directory

   WardenHandler: Main Warden RPC worker
      send_events_limit: max events sent in one bunch, defaults to 10000
      get_events_limit: max events received in one bunch, defaults to 10000
      description: human readable description, sent in server info

E. Command line

   When run from command line, server offers set of commands and options for
runtime and database management. You can also use --help option for each
command and for server itself.

warden_server.py purge [--help] [-l] [-e] [-d DAYS]

   Purge old events or lastlog records. Note that lastlog purge retains at
   least one newest record for each client, even if it is more than number of
   'days' old.

warden_server.py loadmaps [--help]

   Load 'categories' and 'tags' table from 'catmap_mysql.json' and

   them into db at will, should you need to run your own specific SQL queries
   on data directly. Note also that previous content of both tables will be
   lost.
